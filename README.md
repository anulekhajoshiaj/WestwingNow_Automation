# WestwingNow_Automation
To Run the automation suite below Libraries/plugins/IDE needs to be installed:
1. Python 
2. PIP
3. RobotFramework-selenium library
4. Intellibot plugin
5. Any IDE (Used Pycharm)
6. Chrome driver

How to run testcase:
1. Main Testscript is WestWingProductAdd.robot file under pythonProject\TestScripts folder structure.

Run command: robot -d Result WestWingProductAdd.robot

TestSteps
1. Open (https://www.westwingnow.de)
2. Search for "m√∂bel"
3. Click login button and login to the website.
4. Select first product and add to wishlist
5. Verify wishlist icon update and delete product from wishlist.

Note: I tried selecting wishlist icon and logging in to westwingnow
but somehow, again a 15% off login window was appearing into the main screen
and that too was not a very consistent behaviour. 
So, I performed login first and after that added the product into wishlist.
